# sound_garden

Experiments in sound and sonification.

The goal of this project is to produce sonification support
for CS 210/211 projects that use a grid-based graphic display.
The sonification provided with a project should not require
non-standard libraries that students would hve to install,
but instructor support for creating sonifications can require
additional libraries.

Status: Initial experiments in generating and playing
WAV files.
